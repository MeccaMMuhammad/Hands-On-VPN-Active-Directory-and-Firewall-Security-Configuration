üîß Exercise 1 ‚Äì Install and Configure a VPN Server
Key Steps:

Configured ACIDM01 as a Remote Access and VPN server

Enabled Routing and Remote Access (RRAS)

Defined static IP address pool for VPN clients (192.168.0.99‚Äì100)

Enabled detailed logging to monitor VPN access attempts

Configured Windows Defender Firewall to allow VPN traffic across Domain, Private, and Public profiles

Created a custom Event Viewer log filter for RasClient events

üë• Exercise 2 ‚Äì Create VPN User and Client
Step 1: Create VPN User in Active Directory
Created Organizational Unit: Users VPN

Created user: Security Plus (Secplus@aciplab.com)

Granted group membership: Remote Desktop Users

Enabled dial-in access for VPN connection

Step 2: Configure VPN Client
Configured VPN on ACIWIN11 using Windows built-in VPN client

Connected to the VPN server via PPTP using user credentials

Verified successful connection from ACIDM01

Used ACIKALI to ping the VPN-assigned client IP (192.168.0.100) to confirm connectivity

üîê Exercise 3 ‚Äì Configure a L2TP/IPsec VPN
Step 1: Server-Side Configuration
Generated a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) using pskgen.com

Enabled custom IPsec policy on the VPN server

Applied the PSK to Routing and Remote Access (RRAS)

Restarted RRAS services for changes to take effect

Step 2: Client-Side Configuration
Configured new VPN on ACIWIN11 using L2TP/IPsec with PSK

Connected successfully using same user credentials (Secplus)

Verified encrypted tunnel via Windows Defender Firewall > Security Associations

Reviewed Main Mode (encryption and authentication parameters)

Reviewed Quick Mode (data transfer protocols and security encapsulation)

üîç Security Concepts Practiced
Encryption in transit using PPTP and L2TP/IPsec

Authentication and Authorization using Active Directory and VPN Dial-in policies

Firewall configuration to allow secure communication

Logging and Monitoring of VPN access events for accountability and visibility

üåê Why This Matters for My Linux Systems Admin Journey
Although this lab was Windows-focused, it directly supports my goal of becoming a Linux Systems Administrator by reinforcing key security concepts that apply across operating systems:

Implementing secure remote access methods using VPNs

Managing user authentication and directory services

Analyzing logs and managing firewall rules

Understanding IPsec-based encryption protocols

These are the same foundations used in Linux environments (e.g., OpenVPN, IPsec tools, ufw/firewalld, journald, LDAP), making this experience highly transferable.
